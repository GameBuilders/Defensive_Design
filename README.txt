To play the game, select a tower along the bottom row. It will be highlighted by a yellow halo. Click on an area outside of the path to place one of those towers. There are 3 types of towers. An arrow tower is weak, but it sees enemies from afar and shoots often. A rock tower is expensive and shoots not very often, but it is strong. A bomb tower destroys all onscreen enemies, but it is extremely expensive, takes a very long time to fire, and self-destructs when it fires. The game is won by having no more enemies on screen. You get resources for shooting down enemies. No resources are rewarded for kills from a bomb tower. Those resources are carried along to the next level. The game has 3 levels total. Also, you can click the game screen while "SUCCESS!" is shown to start the next level.

This game uses a crayon-based art style in its presentation.
The enemy birds and the beetles the player defends were chosen to match the childish, carefree crayon aesthetic.
